# LuxFocusRedux

LuxFocusRedux is an OSX tray application for use with the Luxafor Flag LED. It automatically changes the colour of the flag based on how long different applications are being used. Applications are grouped into the types: Focus, Free and Ambiguous. Focus apps add red to the flag, indicating the user is busy. Free apps add green to the flag to indicate that the user is interruptable. Ambiguous apps are a catch-all for unclassified apps and will add blue to the flag.

## Installation

The app currently needs to be built in XCode to run.

## Usage

Start the application and let it run for a while. It will record any applications it finds being used and store them. After a few minutes, open the preferences and begin to classify the applications that have been seen.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
